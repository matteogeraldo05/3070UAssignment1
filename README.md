# CSCI3070U Assignment 1

This repo contains solutions to a 4-part algorithm assignment focused on:

1. **Asymptotic Analysis**  
   - Prove: `f(n) + g(n) âˆˆ Î˜(max{f(n), g(n)})`  
   - Solve recurrence: `T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/4) + 1 â†’ O( n)`

2. **Peak Finding in Bitonic Array**  
   - Find the max in a array in `O(log n)` using binary search-based algorithm

3. **Dominant Number (Divide & Conquer)**  
   - Find the number that appears more than `n/2` times 

4. **Heap & Heap Sort**  
   - Full max-heap implementation
